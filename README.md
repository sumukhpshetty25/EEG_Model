EEG-Based Imagined Speech Classification with 3D-CNN + BiLSTM
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model for imagined speech classification using EEG signals. The pipeline converts EEG time-series data into spatio-temporal topographic maps, which are then processed by a 3D-CNN + BiLSTM network.

The model is trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, achieving an average accuracy of 81.67%.
